## About

This is a pet project to build a music player for myself. With plenty of music steaming services available in the market and none of them truly providing a seamless yet cheap streaming experience, I built Ours for us.

Ours is not yet the final product I had envisioned. It is still work in progress. Currently it just about gets the job done.

## Declaration

Because of my inability to find a music api with .mp3 endpoints, I have uploaded all the songs myself seperately. 
All songs and their respective covers are completely owned by their respective producers and owners. 

This is merely a sample project for educational purposes.

## A music player built on ReactJS deployed through Firebase.

I chose to use styled components because of the advantage of being able to style based on props which is much more convenient than adding class and scss modules. 

## Features

```
1. Native app like experience (SPA)
2. Seamless UI
3. Responsive design that works well on mobile devices
4. On screen buttons to control music playback
5. Seek forward or backward by clicking on the dynamic progress bar
6. Music playback even in the background
```

# Working with the Source Code :

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Test it out yourself!

Clone the repository and start testing out the application yourself!

``` git clone https://github.com/rwishavg/Ours.git ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
