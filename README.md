# A music player web-application built on ReactJS.

This project was made by following Dev Ed's react course. In the course, he used scss modules to style, while I used styled components. I choose to use styled components because of the advantage of being able to style based on props, which personally, is much more convenient than adding class and scss modules.

## Test it out yourself!

Clone the repository and start testing out the application yourself!

In the project directory, you can run:

```
1. If you have not installed Yarn:
npm install yarn

2. Install the dependencies:
yarn install

3. Start the project in development mode:
yarn run start
```

If you're ready to deploy the application to the internet, use:
```
yarn run build
```
This will build the app for production to the "build" foler. The built version will be optimized for best performance and can be deployed.
