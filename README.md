# Ours

This was a pet project to build a music player for myself. With plenty of music steaming services available in the market and none of them truly providing a seamless yet cheap streaming experience, I built Ours for us.

Ours is not yet the final product I had envisioned. It is still work in progress. Currently it just about gets the job done.

Because of my inability to find a music api with .mp3 endpoints, I have uploaded all the songs myself seperately. 
All songs and their respective covers are completely owned by their respective producers and owners. 

This is merely a sample project for educational purposes.

## A music player built on ReactJS deployed through Firebase.

I chose to use styled components because of the advantage of being able to style based on props which is much more convenient than adding class and scss modules. 

## Test it out yourself!

Clone the repository and start testing out the application yourself!

``` git clone https://github.com/rwishavg/Ours.git ```

Inside the project directory:

1) To install the dependencies:

```npm install```

2) To start the project in development mode:

```npm run start```

3) If you're ready to deploy the application to the internet, use:

```npm run build```

This will build the app for production to the "build" folder. The built version will be optimized for best performance and can be deployed.
